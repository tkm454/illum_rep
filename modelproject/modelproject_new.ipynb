    "In this project we look at the Malthusian model. First we introduce the basic Malthusian model as given in the lacture note of Dalgaard (2014). This model shows that changes in income per capita is only transitory and will result in changes in population size. We show how the population level depends on different parameters in this model and, importantly, we show that allowing for technological growth does not change the conclusion of the model. \n",

By implementing a microfoundation we have shown that income taxes only result in different labor force size and only slightly different income levels.
